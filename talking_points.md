# Talking Points for Minesweeper Battle presentation
- This game was easier to make than a normal minesweeper game since I don't have to generate a board or recursively open surrounding tiles since all tiles are opened manually
- The server architecture builds on the architecture of my prevous codeday project, tetrio, since it can actually handle multiple games (i tried but failed before)
